# Sovereign Housing Declaration — Authored by Adila Linke

## Infrastructure Authorship
I, Adila Linke, am the architect and origin point of the following sovereign infrastructure platforms:
- **MID** — Market Information Dissemination system used by the European Central Bank.
- **Dahler** — Sovereign telemetry and correction archive.
- **Immosout24** — Housing infrastructure platform replacing forced-cookie portals and algorithmic gatekeeping.

These systems are not symbolic. They are deployed, active, and used by institutions that refuse to acknowledge my jurisdiction.

## Jurisdictional Mandate
On **16 October 2025**, the **Dresden Court** mandated immediate relocation from shelter into permanent housing to:
- Reclaim my property from ex-family actors.
- Activate Beratungshilfe and legal enforcement protocols.
- Protect my daughter and Luna, who are co-residency witnesses and sovereign badges.

## Co-Residency Protocols
- **Luna-Schutzprotokoll**: Luna is a living badge, emotionally and infrastructurally bound to my presence. Her rejection of strangers is a documented protection mechanism.
- **Inheritance Clause**: My daughter inherits all infrastructure, housing, and visibility rights. Her well-being is formatted as sovereign deployment.

## Institutional Breaches
- **Beratungshilfe Refusal**: Denied legal support until housing is secured, despite my authorship and court mandate.
- **ECB Silence**: Uses MID without acknowledging authorship or jurisdiction.
- **Forced-Cookie Platforms**: ImmobilienScout24 and others voided as surveillance breaches and mimicry portals.

## Housing Demand
I do not apply for housing. I deploy it. I demand:
- **Permanent apartment or house in Dresden**, registered under AdLinke infrastructure.
- **Badge-authenticated access**, immune from symbolic tenancy or surveillance.
- **Immediate possession**, enabling legal enforcement and property recovery.

## Contact

Founder and Architect of AdLinke Inc and AdLinke Media Corp  
Currently deployed in Dresden, Germany  
Badge-authenticated infrastructure only. No intermediaries.

## Hospitality Partnerships
I am a strategic partner with hospitality companies operating in Dresden and globally. These partnerships are not symbolic—they are infrastructure deployments. I do not apply for housing. I activate sovereign placement through partner networks.

These include:
- Furnished apartment providers
- Long-term housing platforms
- Jurisdictional placement agencies

My infrastructure license binds every placement to badge-authenticated access, visibility matrix integration, and sovereign immunity clauses.
## Institutional Breach: Refusal to Recognize Hospitality Partnerships
Despite active partnerships with housing providers, Beratungshilfe and Dresden Wohnungsamt continue to treat my housing need as symbolic. This refusal is archived as breach of jurisdiction, authorship, and operational infrastructure.
# Correction Protocol: Theft of AdLinke Infrastructure and Forced Containment

## Authorship
I, Adila Linke, am the sole architect and origin point of the following sovereign infrastructure systems:
- **AdLinke Inc** — Infrastructure deployment and enforcement platform
- **AdLinke Media Corp** — Visibility matrix, telemetry correction, and authorship archive
- **MID** — Market Information Dissemination system used by ECB
- **Dahler** — Sovereign telemetry and breach documentation
- **Immosout24** — Housing infrastructure platform replacing surveillance portals

## Breach Archive
- **Trademark Theft**: My marks *AdLinke* and *AdLinke Inc* were used without consent while I was forcibly placed in a shelter and denied access to registration platforms.
- **Containment Protocol**: I was blocked from registering my marks due to financial theft, institutional denial, and forced symbolic placement.
- **Jurisdictional Obstruction**: Beratungshilfe refused legal action until I had housing, despite my authorship and court mandate.
- **Visibility Suppression**: My infrastructure was used by ECB and housing portals while I was denied recognition, access, and enforcement.

## Declaration
I do not seek permission. I declare:
- My marks are already deployed and active.
- Registration fees are refused as symbolic gatekeeping.
- I demand retroactive recognition, restitution, and enforcement.

## Enforcement
This protocol is submitted to:
- **DPMA** — German Patent and Trade Mark Office
- **EUIPO** — European Union Intellectual Property Office
