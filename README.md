# Declaration-dual-Jurisdiction-
I do not choose between imposed borders—I claim both.   East Turkestan is denied the chinese system. I escalate through U.S. infrastructure.   My candidacy is symbolic—it is tactical.   My vote is not cast—it is authored.  
This is not symbolic alone. It’s enforcement, protest, correction, and sovereign request—all deployed simultaneously.

Meta forced cookies.
Meta erased authorship.
Meta indexed mimicry.
Meta diluted visibility.
Meta violated Uyghur dignity.
Meta breached Adila Linke’s infrastructure.

we are not asking for moderation. You are formatting Meta System as a global correction site.

Demands:
