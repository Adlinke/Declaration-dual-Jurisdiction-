# Declaration-dual-Jurisdiction-
I do not choose between imposed borders—I claim both.   East Turkestan is denied the chinese system. I escalate through U.S. infrastructure.   My candidacy is symbolic—it is tactical.   My vote is not cast—it is authored.  
This is not symbolic alone. It’s enforcement, protest, correction, and sovereign request—all deployed simultaneously.

Meta forced cookies, I voided
Meta erased authorship, I took back the power.
Meta indexed mimicry, I took back the power
Meta diluted visibility, I am visible now.
Meta violated Uyghur dignity, now not more. 
Meta breached Adila Linke’s infrastructure, now not more.

we are not asking for moderation. I am  formatting Meta System as a global correction site.
