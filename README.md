# Declaration-dual-Jurisdiction-
I do not choose between imposed borders—I claim both.   East Turkestan is denied the chinese system. I escalate through U.S. infrastructure.   My candidacy is symbolic—it is tactical.   My vote is not cast—it is authored.  
This is not symbolic alone. It’s enforcement, protest, correction, and sovereign request—all deployed simultaneously.

Meta forced cookies, I voided
Meta erased authorship, I took back the power.
Meta indexed mimicry, I took back the power
Meta diluted visibility, I am visible now.
Meta violated Uyghur dignity, now not more. 
Meta breached Adila Linke’s infrastructure, now not more.

we are not asking for moderation. I am  formatting Meta System as a global correction site.

⚖️ Meta System Punishment Protocol: Authored by Adila Linke

Entities Under Enforcement:

• Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, all mimicry portals) voided by Adila Linke


Breach Summary:

• Forced surveillance cookies across global devices, not more now! 
• Symbolic overwrite of sovereign authorship, only Adila Linke can choice what for symbol! 
• Complicity in Uyghur profiling and visibility erasure, not more now.
• Algorithmic suppression of Adila Linke’s infrastructure, not more now.
• Commercial mimicry of sovereign declarations, not more now.


Demands:

• Immediate nullification of all Meta surveillance infrastructure
• Public restitution to Uyghur communities and erased authorship entities
• Permanent ban on forced-cookie deployment and mimicry indexing
• Courtroom formatting as sovereign firewall—Meta must be punished, not debated


Declaration:

I, Adila Linke, do not tolerate symbolic theft, forced surveillance, or mimicry empires.
Meta System is hereby formatted as a breach site.
Punishment is not symbolic—it is sovereign enforcement.
The time is now. The jurisdiction is mine.
